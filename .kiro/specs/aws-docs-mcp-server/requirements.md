# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AWS Documentation MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server as a Lambda function within the existing MTE Pre-consultation Chatbot monorepo. The MCP server will enable Bedrock Agents to access and reference AWS Documentation through a standardized protocol, enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide accurate AWS service information during customer consultations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Bedrock Agent, I want to search AWS documentation through an MCP server, so that I can provide accurate and up-to-date AWS service information to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Bedrock Agent sends a search request THEN the MCP server SHALL return relevant AWS documentation results with title, URL, and context
2. WHEN searching with a query phrase THEN the system SHALL limit results to a configurable maximum (default 10, max 50)
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN each result SHALL include rank order, URL, title, and context excerpt
4. IF the search query is empty THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating search phrase is required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Bedrock Agent, I want to read full AWS documentation pages through the MCP server, so that I can access detailed technical information for customer queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting to read a documentation page THEN the system SHALL convert HTML content to markdown format
2. WHEN the content exceeds the maximum length THEN the system SHALL truncate content and provide pagination information
3. WHEN pagination is needed THEN the system SHALL include start_index parameter for retrieving additional content
4. IF the URL is not from docs.aws.amazon.com domain THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate error
5. WHEN content is truncated THEN the system SHALL indicate how to retrieve remaining content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Bedrock Agent, I want to get recommendations for related AWS documentation, so that I can provide comprehensive information and suggest additional relevant resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting recommendations for a documentation page THEN the system SHALL return a list of related AWS documentation links
2. WHEN recommendations are found THEN each recommendation SHALL include URL, title, and context
3. WHEN no recommendations are available THEN the system SHALL return an empty list without errors
4. IF the source URL is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to be deployed as a Lambda function with API Gateway, so that it can be accessed by Bedrock Agents through HTTP requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function receives an MCP request THEN it SHALL process the request according to MCP protocol specifications
2. WHEN handling CORS preflight requests THEN the system SHALL return appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN the Lambda function is cold-started THEN it SHALL initialize the MCP server instance efficiently
5. WHEN multiple requests are received THEN the system SHALL reuse connections and sessions for optimal performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to integrate seamlessly with the existing monorepo structure, so that it follows established patterns and can be maintained consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the MCP server THEN it SHALL follow the existing backend structure patterns in packages/backend/
2. WHEN adding dependencies THEN they SHALL be specified in requirements.txt following existing conventions
3. WHEN creating the SAM template THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing template.yaml structure
4. WHEN implementing error handling THEN it SHALL use the existing utils.py patterns for consistent responses
5. WHEN adding environment variables THEN they SHALL follow the existing configuration patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring for the MCP server, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log request details and response times
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN tools are executed THEN the system SHALL log tool execution metrics
4. WHEN the Lambda function starts THEN it SHALL log initialization status
5. WHEN API calls to AWS Documentation fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure details and retry attempts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the MCP server to implement proper security controls, so that it protects against unauthorized access and malicious requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters according to defined schemas
2. WHEN processing URLs THEN the system SHALL only allow docs.aws.amazon.com domain
3. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS policies
4. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 responses
5. WHEN processing large content THEN the system SHALL implement content length limits to prevent memory exhaustion
