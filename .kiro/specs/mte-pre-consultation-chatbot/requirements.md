# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MTE Pre-consultation Chatbot is a conversational AI web system designed to streamline the pre-meeting preparation process between AWS sales teams and customers. The system replaces traditional Excel-based forms with an intuitive chatbot interface that guides customers through a structured conversation to collect business requirements, technical constraints, and project timelines. The collected information is then processed and presented to AWS sales representatives and engineers in an organized, actionable format.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AWS sales representative accesses the admin interface THEN the system SHALL provide options to create new pre-consultation sessions
2. WHEN creating a session THEN the system SHALL require customer contact information and target authority details
3. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique URL that can be shared with the customer
4. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL store the session with "active" status in the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to access the pre-consultation chatbot through a simple URL, so that I can provide my business requirements without needing special software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer accesses the pre-consultation URL THEN the system SHALL display a welcoming chatbot interface
2. WHEN the customer loads the page THEN the system SHALL initialize the conversation with authority recognition questions
3. IF the session URL is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the customer interacts with the chatbot THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation state throughout the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to have a natural conversation with the chatbot about my business needs, so that I can easily communicate my requirements without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL follow the 5-stage conversation flow (Authority, Business, AWS Services, Technical Requirements, Next Steps)
2. WHEN the customer provides an answer THEN the system SHALL generate contextually appropriate follow-up questions
3. WHEN the customer mentions information from a different stage THEN the system SHALL adapt the conversation flow accordingly
4. WHEN the customer provides incomplete information THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding
5. WHEN all required information is collected THEN the system SHALL provide the AWS sales representative contact information and disable further conversation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the chatbot to understand my technical level and adjust its questions accordingly, so that I can provide meaningful responses regardless of my technical background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot detects non-technical responses THEN the system SHALL simplify subsequent questions and provide explanations
2. WHEN the customer uses technical terminology THEN the system SHALL adapt to use more technical language
3. WHEN the customer seems confused THEN the system SHALL provide examples or alternative phrasing
4. WHEN moving between conversation stages THEN the system SHALL provide summaries to confirm understanding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AWS sales representative, I want to view completed pre-consultation results in an admin interface, so that I can prepare effectively for customer meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin interface THEN the system SHALL display a list of all pre-consultation sessions with their status
2. WHEN viewing a completed session THEN the system SHALL show the complete Q&A transcript organized by conversation stages
3. WHEN viewing a completed session THEN the system SHALL provide a 1-page markdown summary of key findings
4. WHEN viewing session details THEN the system SHALL display customer contact information and session metadata
5. WHEN a session is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL allow the sales representative to close/archive the session

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AWS engineer, I want to receive relevant AWS documentation recommendations based on customer requirements, so that I can prepare technical solutions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pre-consultation is completed THEN the system SHALL analyze the collected requirements
2. WHEN technical requirements are identified THEN the system SHALL generate a list of relevant AWS service documentation
3. WHEN compliance requirements are mentioned THEN the system SHALL include relevant security and compliance documentation
4. WHEN specific use cases are identified THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate AWS architecture patterns and best practices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot to be powered by Amazon Bedrock, so that it can provide intelligent, contextual responses and maintain conversation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot generates responses THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock's generative AI capabilities

2. WHEN displaying forms and inputs THEN the system SHALL use Cloudscape components and design tokens
3. WHEN showing data tables and lists THEN the system SHALL follow Cloudscape data presentation patterns
4. WHEN displaying loading states and feedback THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Cloudscape indicators

### Requirement 9
